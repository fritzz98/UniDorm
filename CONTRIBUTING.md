## How to contribute to UniDorm

#### **Licensing**

Licensing is very important to open source projects. It helps ensure the software continues to be available under the terms that the author desired.

UniDorm uses the Apache 2.0 license (as found in the LICENSE file in the project’s GitHub repo) to strike a balance between open contribution and allowing you to use the software however you would like to. The Apache 2.0 license is a permissive open source license that allows you to freely use, modify, distribute and sell your own products that include Apache 2.0 licensed software. 

A license tells you what rights you have as a developer, as provided by the copyright holder. It is important that the contributor fully understands the licensing rights and agrees to them. Sometimes the copyright holder isn’t the contributor, such as when the contributor is doing work on behalf of a company.

#### **Did you find a bug?**


* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/fritzz98/UniDorm/issues).

* Open a new issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/fritzz98/UniDorm/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Licensing?**
