			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p> 
			As students who came to live and study in another country, we have faced up different issues while finding the perfect accommodation for ourselves. 
			<br>
			Also, it is difficult to integrate into the city where the foreign language is spoken and when one does not have any acquaintances.
			<br><br><br>
			Our vision is to create a network of students and student dormitories as well as the network between students themselves. 
			It is our goal to get 80% of the target cities student dorms to use our app in the first 3 years.
			<br><br><br>
				Our mission is to create such an app that will make the beginning of the study for abroad students much easier. <br>
				UniDorm is the app that unifies all student dormitories based in a particular city. <br>
				The app will contain all important information about every dorm and will be designed so that is easy to use. <br>
				Students will be able to enter a variety of preferences when it comes to choosing the perfect place for living. <br>
				Based on the selected choices such as University location, preferably price range, type of the room etc. the app will offer a few of the best options. <br>
				After getting accepted by the student dorm, the students will have access to chat rooms where they can connect with other students.</p>
